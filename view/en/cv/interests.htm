    Since 2014, my professional focus has been on Android (AOSP) and, later,
    Android Automotive (AAOS) &ndash; specifically, the development of system
    and end-user software for devices running these operating systems.
    Currently, I'm the head of the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://auto.yandex/">Yandex Auto</a> product at
    Yandex &ndash; a solution built on Android Automotive OS that brings
    together Yandex services (such as Navigation, Alice, Music, Fuel, Parking,
    Weather, Video, and others) and makes them convenient to use in a vehicle.
    Beyond that, Yandex Auto is a complete HMI (Human-Machine Interface)
    solution that includes all the necessary components for managing the
    multimedia system (In-Vehicle Infotainment, IVI) and vehicle settings
    (HVAC, Body, etc.).

    Beyond my day-to-day work, I have a strong interest in other areas of
    computer science, including compilers and programming languages, operating
    systems, databases, and embedded systems.
