    With over 22 years of experience as a software engineer, team leader, and
    head of department, I have built expertise across the full project lifecycle
    &ndash; from architecture and infrastructure design through development,
    testing, and integration, all the way to product and project management. I
    have worked on web projects, databases, and desktop, system, and mobile
    applications.
