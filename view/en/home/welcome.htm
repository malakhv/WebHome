    Welcome to my home in web! I fully understand that to have a home page in
    2024 is old-fashioned :) Maybe, but I have no actual accounts in social
    networks (except Instagram and Lomography, I just love traveling and photos
    and I use it only for this) because there is a lot of information noise and
    unnecessary news. I want to consume only correct and actual for me content.
    Without social networks I really feel freer and more independent.

    On these pages you can learn more about me, my projects and my hobbies.
    Also, you can find information about useful tools, helpful links and
    documentation that I use in everyday life. Since this website is under
    construction, not all materials are available, but I hope you could find
    something interesting.

    And small remark about the content on these pages. The English is not my
    native language, so I can make mistakes. I'm sorry about that. If you don't
    like something at all, please write me about it and I will be able to
    fix&nbsp;:)
