        <p>Below, you could see my current development environment (technologies, tools and etc). I use all of these in my work and my personal projects. Right now my primary programming language is Java. But I love Pascal! I think, this is a best language for education and understanding programming. And, as you may have noticed, Kotlin is missing from my list. I have not found an answer to the question, why I need it.</p>
